# SOP RAG Update System - Project Overview

This project aims to create a locally-run system that uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to help update Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by analyzing company documents. The system will provide a conversational interface to discuss document updates, with the AI offering suggestions that can be accepted or rejected.
